Branched off master.

Adding packages: 
    - React (react & react-dom): Front end framework
    - Webpack: handle package dependencies
    - Babel: compile newer js to older versions that most browsers support

Edited packages.json to use webpack to build the app (handle dependencies).

Added webpack config file to setup source of js code and destination for final
bundle for user. See link for structure: 
https://webpack.js.org/configuration/

Added template main page in public/index.html, which is used by React.

Added src folder and template React file (app.jsx) and an entry point for Webpack (index.js)
